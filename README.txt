Fork is like a duplicate repository, with this we can change the project or task as we need.
If we are doing like this, there is no affect on the the original project.
Based on the requirement we can add the code, we can delete or we can change the code.

By using Fork we can give suggestions to the owner of that project, or we can update or we can adding extra features.
some students may take it for reference, may be the students will get good ideas so they will extend the project.
It's like sharing our knowledge and idea.

After clicking on the Fork only we can access the Repository, and then we can clone to our local files.
now we can change the project as we want, then we can commit, and we can push.

If we want to update with our new or changed code to the original project, we can raise the pull-request, if they approve then your updated code will be treated as latest version of that project.
If your not interetsed to give the code you can use it for your self.
